# DTSA 5510 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning Final Project  
### Problem Definition

This project focuses on applying **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to cluster countries based on a set of **socio-economic and health indicators**.  
The aim is to identify groups of countries with similar development profiles in order to inform international aid allocation decisions.  
This is a **clustering problem**, where the model should uncover hidden patterns in the data without using any labels.

### Problem Description

**HELP International**, a global humanitarian NGO, has raised **$10 million** in funding.  
The CEO needs to determine **which countries should be prioritized** for receiving aid.  
As a data scientist, your task is to use clustering algorithms to analyze the countriesâ€™ development data and recommend the countries most in need of assistance.

By using unsupervised learning, we can form meaningful clusters of countries and guide HELP International in making **data-driven decisions** to strategically deploy their resources.

### About the Data

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle: Unsupervised Learning on Country Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data/data). It contains numerical indicators for countries across various development dimensions.

#### Features Overview:
- **Demographic & Economic**:
  - `Country`: Country name  
  - `GDP`: Gross Domestic Product  
  - `Income`: Net income per person  
  - `Exports`: % of GDP  
  - `Imports`: % of GDP  
  - `Inflation`: Consumer price inflation  
  - `Population`: In millions  

- **Health & Human Development**:
  - `Child Mortality`: Deaths under age 5 per 1,000  
  - `Health`: Govt. health spending as % of GDP  
  - `Life Expectancy`: Average years  
  - `Total Fertility`: Avg. number of children per woman

#### Data Type:
- All features are **numerical**  
- Format: **Tabular**  
- Number of Observations: 160+ countries
